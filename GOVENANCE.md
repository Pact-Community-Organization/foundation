# Governance (Hybrid MVG)

This repository holds the canonical governance documents for the Pact Community Organization. The organization follows a Hybrid governance model (Minimum Viable Governance — MVG) with room to extend as the community grows.

## Model overview
- Hybrid MVG: lightweight day-to-day governance now, with explicit roles and a process for formalizing decisions as the project scales.

## Roles
- **Core Maintainers**: hold merge rights for core repositories; responsible for releases, major policy decisions.
- **Council**: small advisory body for governance decisions and conflicts (appointed initially, later elected via RFC process).
- **Security WG**: triages security reports and coordinates responses.
- **Contributors**: anyone submitting PRs and issues; contributors may be promoted to maintainers via nomination.

## Decision process
- **RFC process**: proposals are additions/changes via PRs to `foundation/docs/rfcs/`.
- Low-risk changes can be merged by Core Maintainers after review.
- High-impact changes require an RFC and a Council review period (14 days) prior to merge.

## Appointments and elections
- Initial maintainers and Council members are appointed by the founding steward (`DaisukeFlowers`).
- The RFC process will include guidance for elections and nominations when community size warrants.

## Conflict resolution
- Conflicts should be reported to `info@pact-community.org` and the Council will mediate.

## Amendments
- This governance document may be amended via an RFC and majority approval by the Council.
