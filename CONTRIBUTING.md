3.  Make your changes in your feature branch.
4.  Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message (`git commit -m 'feat: Add YourAmazingFeature'`).
5.  Push your branch to your fork (`git push origin feature/YourAmazingFeature`).
6.  Open a **Pull Request** to the `main` branch of the original repository.
