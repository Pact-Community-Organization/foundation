# Maintainers

This document describes how maintainers are nominated and what responsibilities they hold.

## Current Process (November 2025)
- **Nominations**: All maintainer nominations are reviewed by the organization owner (DaisukeFlowers)
- **Responsibilities**: Code review, merging PRs, release management, and onboarding new contributors.
- **Removal**: Maintainers may be removed by organization owner decision; appeals handled directly.

## Future Process (When Council is Established)
- Nominations: Maintainers are nominated by existing Core Maintainers or the Council.
- Removal: Maintainers may be removed by Council vote if necessary; the RFC process documents removal and appeals.
